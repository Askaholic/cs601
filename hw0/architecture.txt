Registers:
  There are 16 general purpose registers (0 - 15) as well as a program counter
  and a control register for debugging.

Instructions:
  Each instruction is 16-bits wide

  0xFmmj - LOAD from mem location m into register j
  0x1mmj - STORE from register j into mem location m
  0x2#jk - ADD reg[j] += reg[k]
  0x3iij - ADD IMMEDIATE. Add value ii to register j.
  0x4iij - BRANCH IF EQUAL TO ZERO.
            Adds the constant i to the program counter if register j is equal to
            zero.
  0x5iij - BRANCH IF LESS THAN ZERO.
            Adds the constant i to the program counter if register j is less
            than zero.
  0x6##j - READ an integer and store it in register j
  0x7##j - PRINT the integer in register j
  0x8ii# - JUMP to instruction i
  0x9#jk - SUB reg[j] -= reg[k]
  0xA#kj - STORE from register j into mem location reg[k]
  0xB#kj - LOAD from mem location reg[k] into register j
  0xC#jk - XOR reg[j] ^= reg[k]
