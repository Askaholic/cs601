Registers:
  There are 16 general purpose registers (0 - 15) as well as a program counter
  and a control register for debugging.

Instructions:
  Each instruction is 16-bits wide

  0xFmmj - LOAD from mem location m into register j
  0x1mmj - STORE from register j into mem location m
  0x2#jk - ADD value in register k to register j. Bits in # are ignored.
  0x3iij - ADD IMMEDIATE. Add value ii to register j.
  0x4iij - BRANCH IF EQUAL TO ZERO.
            Adds the constant i to the program counter if register j is equal to
            zero.
  0x5iij - BRANCH IF NOT EQUAL TO ZERO.
            Adds the constant i to the program counter if register j is not
            equal to zero.
  0x6##j - READ an integer and store it in register j
